# ASA Swim time converter

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/paulcull/asa-swim-time-converter.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a javascript implementation of the published and ASA approved Factor Table conversion method.

## Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paulcull/asa-swim-time-converter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paulcull/asa-swim-time-converter)


## Getting Started

Include the library in your project. Pass the Stroke, Pool Length From / To and timing. The single function will return the convert time.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
None
```

### Installing

Install the library using npm...

```
npm install --save asa-swim-time-converter
```

...or, take the library directly from githb

```
git clone https://github.com/paulcull/asa-swim-time-converter
```

This library uses promises. The function when called returns a promise, allowing you to get on with anything else that you need to.
There are no runtime 3rd party dependencies in this library.

```
var getTime = require('asa-swim-time-converter');

getTime("50 Free", "25m", "50m", "31.0").then(function(newTime){
    console.log(newTime);
})
```

## Running the tests

There are a limited number of tests. Several negative tests and a couple of checks on times to convert


```
npm test
```


## Deployment

Not designed to run stand-alone - this should be used as a libray.
